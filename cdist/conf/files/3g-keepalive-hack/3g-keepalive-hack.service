# This is the core of this service: An infinitely running ping with a
# short interval (-i), without generating output (-q) and without any
# payload (-s).
# This pings to an IP address reserved for "testing purposes", which
# should not be actually routable. This address seems to route to the
# default gateway of the ISP, but does not actually reach anyone. This
# prevents having to bug a server with our traffic, and means ther is no
# return traffic, saving half the bandwidth.
# Before doing the ping, check if there are any Huawei devices present.
# If not, just return.
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "\
lsusb -d12d1:14dc: && ping -q -i 3 -s 0 192.168.8.1 || \
lsusb -d12d1: && ping -q -i 3 -s 0 192.0.2.1 || \
echo 'No Huawei device found, no need to ping'"

# Make sure to recheck for a Huawei device every 5min if not found.
# Also, if the ping crashes for some reason, this makes sure to restart
# (after a 5min delay too).  # needed, it also restarted. In both cases,
# this waits 5 minutes before doing the restart.
